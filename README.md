## Context

- Instead of using the images I used for the previous assignments, I opted to do different set of images as I got bored. 
- forEach Loop inserted in the client.js is the same as the previous assignment which used Gallery HTML
  - I didn't use the arrows for the client.js out of the fear it would break my code.(--sorry for the inconsistency!)
  - 404 isn't outsourced from a separate HTML cause I figured I did it wrong from the previous assignment and I didn't want to risk it.

## Attribution 

All Images were taken by Karen Sule. 

## Helpers

As per usual, Ellie, Erica, and Kyle are the emotional support team.

**Also**, Norville as the good mentor and leader he is, kept checking up on me if I'm still doing okay (which I wasn't but that's for some other time). 

**HUGE SHOUTOUT** to Vitaly because I wouldn't have done the assignment properly if it wasn't for him. He taught me and included dayJS in my code plus helped me with making my fetch work.
